Trying to get Samsung Odyssey + to work on linux with openhmd


## WIP LOG:

#### History
I can't get my **Samsung Odyssey +** running in linux with openhmd. The screen stays off but the device sends back IMU data. 

Issues : 
- Screen stays off
- There seems to be some delay with WMR and when openhmd tries to access device configuration, it will not respond. There has to be more retries and longer wait time for it to work. I also found that sometime starting the exemples programmes a few times in a row will make it work. This has to be fixed as it's a big issue for openhmd-wmr.
- Missing screen on usb cmd
I think that a bulk usb transfer cmd must be sent to enable the HDMI display. So I went and captured USB data in Windows and try to look for suspicius things.

### Status

#### USB Identiy

This is from openhmd-wmr-controllers.

```
#define MICROSOFT_VID                   0x045e
#define HOLOLENS_SENSORS_PID            0x0659
#define MOTION_CONTROLLER_PID           0x065b
#define MOTION_CONTROLLER_PID_SAMSUNG   0x065d
```

#### Proximity switch

The device sends back a interupt when the internal proximity switch sense that you put the headset on your head.
The leftover hex data is **10 01 47 06**. A second interupt is sent when the switch is unpressed because you removed your headset. It's **10 00 46 06**. It's from endpoint 0x81,

#### Onboard camera

Also, the onboard camera have to be enabled. Thanks to pH5 for pointing out the [information](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD/issues/200). It's a 12-byte bulk data sent to endpoint **0x05**. The way it works, a first cmd is sent to disable the camera stream and a second one is sent to re-enable it. Looking at the hex data, it's  : 
```
44 6c 6f 2b 0c 00 00 00 82 00 00 00
```
```
44 6c 6f 2b 0c 00 00 00 81 00 00 00
```

There was a [pull request #208](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD/pull/208) by mossvr that added camera support, but was not allowed as it used libusb. It's good as reference and nice that he made it.

#### Other communication from host to OpenHMD

Looking at comunication from host to endpoint **0x05**, there are not many packets from the time the proximity switch is togled on to when the display is actually lit up. Excluding the 2 packets for the camera, I captured 16 other packets.

They share some similarity as they all start with same 10 bytes. Only the 9th byte of them is different from the camera command. For the rest, they don't have much variations in the 14 first bytes except the 11th byte that flips from 00 to 01. For now, I could assume that they are a sequence of initialization. Afterward, I did a longer capture and got lots of those packets ! I think that the 15th byte is some sort of timestamp. 


In my captures, I got a few unique packet that are a mystery.

#### Video packets

Stated from pH5 : "While the stream is active, video frames are captured via 616538-byte bulk transfers from endpoint 0x85. These contain 25 packets of 24576 bytes and one 2138-byte packet, with a 32-byte header each. Strip the headers, and the payload contains a 1280x481 8-bit grayscale image of both sensors with some metadata in the first line." 
"Every third frame is brighter, with a long exposure for headset tracking, the others are for controller tracking with a very short exposure. Bytes 6-7 of the first line for each sensor are either 0x2c 0x01 (little endian 300) or 0x00 0x00 depending on the frame type."
